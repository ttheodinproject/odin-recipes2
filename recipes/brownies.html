    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat. If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>
    <p>These vegan brownies are rich, chewy, and feature a wonderfully crisp crust.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
        <li>4 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water or coffee</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: In a large, heavy saucepan, over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Place the onions in the saucepan and saute them until they are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic; cook 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Place the tomatoes, tomato paste, basil and parsley in the saucepan. Stir well, turn the heat to low and let the sauce simmer covered for 1 hour. Add the salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is cooking bring a large kettle of salted water to a boil. Boil the lasagna noodles for 9 minutes, then drain and rinse well.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place the tofu blocks in a large bowl. Add the garlic, basil and parsley. Add the salt and pepper, and mash all the ingredients together by squeezing pieces of tofu through your fingers. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole pan. Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles, sprinkle one-third of the tofu mixture over the noodles. Distribute the spinach evenly over the tofu. Next ladle 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce over the tofu, and top it with another layer of the noodles. Then sprinkle another 1/3 of the tofu mixture over the noodles, top the tofu with 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce, and place a final layer of noodles over the tomato sauce. Finally, top the noodles with the final 1/3 of the tofu, and spread the remaining tomato sauce over everything.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake the lasagna for 30 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
