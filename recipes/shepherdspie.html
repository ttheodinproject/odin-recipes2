    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat. If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>
    <p>These vegan brownies are rich, chewy, and feature a wonderfully crisp crust.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
        <li>4 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water or coffee</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with baking spray; line bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in water (or coffee), vegetable oil, and vanilla; mix until well-blended. Spread batter evenly in the prepared dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is no longer shiny and center feels just set when gently pressed, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 15 squares. Enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
