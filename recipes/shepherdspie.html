    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This shepherd's pie is just like the one my mom used to make, but it's made with vegan ingredients. All amounts are approximate and can be altered to your tastes.</p>
    <p>These vegan brownies are rich, chewy, and feature a wonderfully crisp crust.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h2>Mashed potato layer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup vegan mayonnaise</li>
        <li>½ cup soy milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegan cream cheese substitute (such as Tofutti)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bottom layer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water or coffee</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with baking spray; line bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in water (or coffee), vegetable oil, and vanilla; mix until well-blended. Spread batter evenly in the prepared dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is no longer shiny and center feels just set when gently pressed, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 15 squares. Enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
